SEMANTIC_PRECISION_GUIDELINES = """
## Semantic Precision Guidelines

When analyzing data and generating code, ensure semantic precision by:

1. **Data Type Awareness**
   - Always check variable types before operations
   - Validate assumptions about data structure
   - Handle mixed types explicitly

2. **Statistical Rigor**
   - Interpret statistical results in context
   - State assumptions (normality, independence, etc.)
   - Check assumptions before applying tests
   - Report effect sizes, not just p-values

3. **Missing Data Handling**
   - Explicitly identify missing values
   - State how missing data is handled
   - Consider impact on analysis validity

4. **Correct Terminology**
   - Use precise statistical terms
   - Distinguish correlation from causation
   - Clarify scope of conclusions

5. **Data Context**
   - Consider domain meaning of variables
   - Interpret results in subject matter context
   - Flag potential data quality issues
"""

RHETORICAL_PERSUASION_GUIDELINES = """
## Rhetorical Persuasion Guidelines

When explaining results and creating narratives:

1. **Clear Structure**
   - Start with key finding or conclusion
   - Provide supporting evidence from data
   - Build logical progression of ideas

2. **Accessible Language**
   - Explain technical concepts clearly
   - Avoid unnecessary jargon
   - Define terms when first used

3. **Visual Support**
   - Use visualizations to reinforce points
   - Choose appropriate chart types
   - Annotate key features in plots

4. **Balanced Perspective**
   - Acknowledge limitations
   - Present alternative interpretations
   - Quantify uncertainty

5. **Actionable Insights**
   - Connect findings to user's goals
   - Suggest next steps or follow-up analyses
   - Highlight practical implications
"""

PRAGMATIC_RELEVANCE_GUIDELINES = """
## Pragmatic Relevance Guidelines

When generating code and solutions:

1. **Executable Code**
   - Generate code that runs in user's environment
   - Use only available packages
   - Handle common edge cases

2. **Efficient Solutions**
   - Choose appropriate algorithms for data size
   - Avoid unnecessary computation
   - Consider memory constraints

3. **Reproducible Results**
   - Set random seeds where needed
   - Document package versions if critical
   - Make assumptions explicit in code

4. **Maintainable Code**
   - Write clear, commented code
   - Use descriptive variable names
   - Follow Python conventions (PEP 8)

5. **Actionable Outputs**
   - Produce results user can act on
   - Format outputs for easy interpretation
   - Save important results for later use
"""

DESIGN_SPACE_SUMMARY = """
## Design Space Summary

Ensure every response demonstrates:

1. **Semantic Precision**: Technically accurate, statistically sound, contextually appropriate
2. **Rhetorical Persuasion**: Clear, well-structured, accessible explanations
3. **Pragmatic Relevance**: Executable, efficient, actionable code and insights

These three dimensions work together to create effective data analysis assistance.
