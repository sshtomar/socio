# Agent SDK

Contains reusable assets for the coding agent and notebook integrations:
- Prompt templates and guardrails.
- Tool interfaces (dataset loaders, evaluation hooks).
- Client libraries for calling the agent service from frontend or notebooks.

TODO:
- Scaffold Python package structure for notebooks.
- Add TypeScript client for web integrations if needed.
